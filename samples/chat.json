The alternatives would be:\n1. **Store the repo name somewhere else** (but where? another repo? defeats the purpose)\n2. **Use a fixed naming convention** (your approach - ✅ best option)\n3. **Search for repos with a specific topic/description** (overly complex)\n\nFixed name is definitely the way to go.\n\n## Metadata Repo Structure Brainstorm\n\n### Option A: Single YAML Structure\n```\nrepo-organizer-metadata/\n├── README.md\n├── schema.yml          # Global column definitions & types\n├── folders.yml         # Folder hierarchy definition\n└── repos/\n    ├── own/\n    │   ├── username-reponame.yml\n    │   └── username-another-repo.yml\n    └── starred/\n        ├── owner-reponame.yml\n        └── anotherowner-repo.yml\n```\n\n### Option B: Consolidated Structure\n```\nrepo-organizer-metadata/\n├── README.md\n├── schema.yml          # Global column definitions & types\n├── organization.yml    # Folder hierarchy + all repo metadata\n└── archived/          # Old/renamed repos (optional)\n    └── ...\n```\n\n### My Recommendation: **Option A** because:\n- **Easier conflict resolution**: Each repo is a separate file\n- **Better for large collections**: Doesn't create one massive file\n- **Cleaner updates**: Only touch files that changed\n- **Git-friendly**: Better diff/blame history per repo\n\n### File Structure Details:\n\n**schema.yml**:\n```yaml\nversion: \"1.0\"\ncolumns:\n  priority:\n    type: \"integer\"\n    min: 1\n    max: 5\n    default: 3\n  technology_stack:\n    type: \"array\"\n    items: \"string\"\n  last_reviewed:\n    type: \"date\"\n    format: \"YYYY-MM-DD\"\n  notes:\n    type: \"text\"\n    multiline: true\n  custom_url:\n    type: \"url\"\n    validation: \"^https?://\"\n```\n\n**folders.yml**:\n```yaml\nversion: \"1.0\"\nstructure:\n  - name: \"Active Projects\"\n    id: \"active\"\n    children:\n      - name: \"Web Apps\"\n        id: \"active.webapps\"\n      - name: \"CLI Tools\"\n        id: \"active.cli\"\n  - name: \"Learning\"\n    id: \"learning\"\n  - name: \"Archived\"\n    id: \"archived\"\nrepos:\n  \"peckjon/repo-organizer\": \"active.webapps\"\n  \"torvalds/linux\": \"learning\"\n```\n\n**repos/own/peckjon-repo-organizer.yml**:\n```yaml\ntype: \"own\"  # own, forked, starred\nfolder_id: \"active.webapps\"\nfields:\n  priority: 5\n  technology_stack: [\"python\", \"flask\", \"javascript\"]\n  notes: \"Personal project for GitHub repo organization\"\n  last_reviewed: \"2025-09-12\"\n```\n\n## Update Strategy Options:\n\n1. **Immediate save**: Every change commits immediately (might be noisy)\n2. **Session-based save**: Save all changes when user clicks \"Save\" or navigates away\n3. **Auto-save with throttling**: Save after 30 seconds of inactivity\n\n**Recommendation**: **Session-based save** with auto-save backup to localStorage\n\n## Data Conflict Resolution Strategy:\n\n```python\ndef resolve_field_conflicts(repo_data, schema):\n    resolved = {}\n    errors = []\n    \n    for field_name, value in repo_data.get('fields', {}).items():\n        # Field name case insensitive matching\n        schema_field = find_schema_field_ignore_case(field_name, schema)\n        \n        if not schema_field:\n            # Field not in schema - add as text type\n            errors.append(f\"Unknown field '{field_name}' treated as text\")\n            resolved[field_name.lower()] = str(value)\n            continue\n            \n        # Type validation & coercion\n        try:\n            resolved[schema_field['canonical_name']] = coerce_to_type(value, schema_field)\n        except ValidationError as e:\n            errors.append(f\"Field '{field_name}': {e.message}, using default\")\n            resolved[schema_field['canonical_name']] = schema_field.get('default')\n    \n    return resolved, errors\n```\n\n## Cleanup Strategy for Old/Dead Files:\n- **Keep a manifest** in folders.yml of all known repos\n- **On load**: Flag YAML files not in manifest as \"orphaned\"\n- **User action**: Show orphaned files in UI, let user decide to delete or re-assign\n- **Auto-cleanup**: After 30 days, move orphaned files to `archived/` folder\n\n## Questions for you:\n1. **Commit strategy**: Should each save be one commit, or batch related changes?\n2. **Conflict resolution UI**: Show errors in a toast notification, or dedicated validation panel?\n3. **Schema evolution**: How should we handle schema updates when new column types are added?\n4. **Repo renames/moves**: GitHub repos can be renamed - should we detect and update the YAML files automatically?\n\nOnce you confirm these details, I'll update the PRD with all this information.

Also if we detect them navigating away / closing.\n\nData Conflict Resolution Strategy: good... let's move things to \"archived\" right away (no delay). And make sure the orphaned stuff feels natural and doesn't muddy the main view, so maybe that gets its own page/view called \"Archived\" or somesuch. Don't use the naked term \"delete\" here, because that'll make them worry they are destroying repos -- use somethink like \"unlink\" or \"disconnect\" and when they press it, make it clear they're choosing to permanently clear out their notes and custom fields about that repo.\n\nAlso: if they delete a field in the main tabular view, we may need to warn the user. If there's no value data for that field, just remove the field, But if there is, check in with the user first using a phrase like \"This will permanently delete N nonempty values ([list a few]...) are you sure?\"\n\nDid I miss anything?",

Let me address your questions and clarify the structure:\n\n## Metadata Repo Structure: Physical Folders vs YAML Structure\n\n**Option A: Physical folder structure** (I think this is what you're suggesting):\n```\nrepo-organizer-metadata/\n├── README.md\n├── schema.yml\n├── Personal Projects/\n│   ├── _folder.yml           # folder metadata\n│   ├── Web Apps/\n│   │   ├── _folder.yml\n│   │   ├── peckjon-repo-organizer.yml\n│   │   └── peckjon-my-website.yml\n│   └── CLI Tools/\n│       └── peckjon-dotfiles.yml\n├── Learning/\n│   ├── _folder.yml\n│   ├── torvalds-linux.yml    # starred repo\n│   └── microsoft-vscode.yml  # starred repo\n└── Archived/\n    ├── _folder.yml\n    └── old-deleted-repo.yml\n```\n\n**Benefits of physical folders**:\n- ✅ More intuitive file organization\n- ✅ Eliminates need for folders.yml mapping\n- ✅ Natural \"own vs starred\" mixing\n- ✅ Easy to browse in GitHub web interface\n- ✅ Drag-and-drop between folders = file moves\n\n**Potential issues**:\n- ❓ Folder names with special characters/spaces (solvable with proper encoding)\n- ❓ Moving repos between folders = git file moves (actually fine)\n- ❓ Nested folder limits in git (not really an issue at 5 levels)\n\n**My recommendation**: **Go with physical folders!** It's much more intuitive and eliminates the mapping complexity.\n\n## Updated Structure Details:\n\n**_folder.yml** (in each folder):\n```yaml\nname: \"Web Apps\"\ndescription: \"Active web application projects\"\ncolor: \"#3498db\"  # optional UI color\ncreated: \"2025-09-12\"\n```\n\n**Individual repo files**:\n```yaml\ntype: \"starred\"  # own, forked, starred\ngithub_url: \"https://github.com/torvalds/linux\"\nfields:\n  priority: 4\n  technology_stack: [\"c\", \"kernel\", \"systems\"]\n  notes: \"Learning systems programming concepts\"\n  last_reviewed: \"2025-09-10\"\n```\n\n## Clarifications on Your Points:\n\n✅ **Auto-save**: Every 30 seconds if changes detected + on navigation/close\n✅ **Archived immediately**: No 30-day delay, straight to \"Archived\" view\n✅ **\"Unlink/Disconnect\"** terminology instead of \"delete\"\n✅ **Field deletion warnings**: Count non-empty values and show examples\n\n## Additional Considerations:\n\n1. **Folder renames**: When user renames a folder in the UI, we'll need to rename the actual directory and update the `_folder.yml`\n\n2. **Root-level repos**: Should there be a special \"Uncategorized\" or \"Root\" folder, or can repos live at the top level?\n\n3. **Folder creation**: Should empty folders be allowed (with just `_folder.yml`) or only created when repos are added?\n\n4. **Case sensitivity**: Folder names case-sensitive in filesystem, but should UI be case-insensitive for search/navigation?\n\n## Did you miss anything? \n\nI think we covered the main points! The only thing I'd add:\n\n- **Validation on folder moves**: If they drag a repo to a new folder, validate that the repo metadata is compatible with any folder-specific constraints (if we add those later)\n\n- **Bulk operations**: Maybe not v1, but consider how bulk \"move to folder\" or \"add field to selected repos\" would work with this structure\n\nDoes the physical folder approach sound good to you? I think it's much cleaner than the YAML mapping approach. Once you confirm, I'll update the PRD with all these decisions!",

Introduction & Vision\n\n**Repo Organizer** is a personal GitHub repository management tool that helps developers organize, annotate, and track their own repositories and starred projects. The application provides a clean, tabular interface for organizing repos into nested folders with custom metadata, notes, and tracking fields.\n\n**Problem:** Developers accumulate dozens or hundreds of GitHub repositories (own projects, forks, and starred repos) over time, making it difficult to maintain organization, track project status, remember context, or find specific repositories when needed.\n\n**Solution:** A web-based organizer that fetches all your GitHub repositories and starred projects, allows you to organize them into a hierarchical folder structure, and lets you add custom metadata, notes, and tracking information. All organization data is stored in a dedicated GitHub repository for version control and portability.\n\n**Impact:** Improved developer productivity through better repository organization, enhanced project tracking, and reduced time spent searching for or remembering project context.",

Data Management & Storage Strategy\n\n### Save & Sync Strategy\n*   **Immediate Save:** Structural changes (folder creation, renames, repository moves, field schema changes) saved immediately to GitHub\n*   **Auto-Save:** Field value changes (notes, custom fields) auto-saved every 30 seconds if changes detected\n*   **Navigation Save:** Unsaved changes automatically saved when user navigates away or closes browser\n*   **Local Backup:** Unsaved changes stored in browser localStorage as backup until successfully synced\n\n### Data Types & Schema Management\n*   **Supported Field Types:** string, integer, float, boolean, date (YYYY-MM-DD), array, URL, enum, text (multiline)\n*   **Schema Definition:** Global field types defined in `schema.yml` with validation rules, defaults, and constraints\n*   **Field Naming:** Case-sensitive canonical names in schema, case-insensitive (lowercase) storage in individual repo files\n*   **Empty Field Handling:** Empty fields omitted from YAML files but displayed as empty values in UI table\n\n### Conflict Resolution & Data Validation\n*   **Type Coercion:** Automatic conversion of field values to match schema types where possible\n*   **Fallback Handling:** Invalid values fall back to schema defaults with user notification\n*   **Unknown Fields:** Fields not in schema treated as text type with warning notification\n*   **Error Logging:** All data conflicts and validation errors logged for user review\n\n### Cleanup & Archival System\n*   **Orphaned Repository Detection:** Repositories no longer accessible via GitHub API automatically moved to \"Archived\" folder\n*   **User-Initiated Unlinking:** \"Unlink/Disconnect\" action (not \"delete\") removes repository from organization with confirmation\n*   **Field Deletion Protection:** Deleting fields with non-empty values requires confirmation: \"This will permanently delete N non-empty values ([examples]...) are you sure?\"\n*   **Archived Repository Management:** Separate \"Archived\" view for managing previously organized but no longer accessible repositories",

Fill PRD template placeholders\\n2. Validate tech stack: Flask, Bootstrap, jQuery, SQLite, fly.io\\n3. Brainstorm key decisions\\n4. Ensure appropriate scope for v1\\n\\n## Tech Stack Analysis & Recommendations\\n\\n**Assistant's Analysis:**\\n- ✅ Keep: Flask + jQuery + Bootstrap (good for interactivity without complexity)\\n- ✅ Keep: fly.io (great for personal projects)\\n- ❌ Remove: SQLite (not needed - using YAML in GitHub repo)\\n\\n**Key Design Benefits Identified:**\\n- YAML in GitHub repo = version controlled notes\\n- No database maintenance required\\n- Portable across deployments\\n- Can be edited directly if needed\\n\\n## Key Questions & User Responses\\n\\n**Assistant asked about:**\\n\\n1. **Nested folder depth**: What's the maximum?\\n   - **User:** 5 levels max (most people will use 1-3)\\n\\n2. **Custom fields**: Text-only or typed fields?\\n   - **User:** Typed fields, but no binary files/images (links OK)\\n\\n3. **GitHub API rate limits**: Caching strategy?\\n   - **User:** Browser cache\\n\\n4. **Metadata repo naming**: Fixed or configurable?\\n   - **User:** Must be \\\"repo-organizer-metadata\\\" - if configurable, we'd need to store that fact somewhere else!\\n\\n5. **Table interaction**: How to organize repos?\\n   - **User:** Both drag-and-drop AND context menus/buttons\\n\\n## Metadata Repository Structure Brainstorm\\n\\n**Assistant presented two options:**\\n\\n### Option A: Separate files per repo\\n```\\nrepo-organizer-metadata/\\n├── README.md\\n├── schema.yml\\n├── folders.yml\\n└── repos/\\n    ├── own/\\n    └── starred/\\n```\\n\\n### Option B: Consolidated structure\\n```\\nrepo-organizer-metadata/\\n├── README.md\\n├── schema.yml\\n├── organization.yml\\n└── archived/\\n```\\n\\n**Assistant recommended Option A** for better conflict resolution, scalability, and git-friendliness.\\n\\n**User then suggested:** Should we use physical folders in the metadata repo instead of folders.yml mapping?\\n\\n**Assistant analyzed physical folder approach:**\\n```\\nrepo-organizer-metadata/\\n├── README.md\\n├── schema.yml\\n├── Personal Projects/\\n│   ├── _folder.yml\\n│   ├── Web Apps/\\n│   │   ├── _folder.yml\\n│   │   ├── peckjon-repo-organizer.yml\\n│   │   └── peckjon-my-website.yml\\n│   └── CLI Tools/\\n└── Learning/\\n    ├── _folder.yml\\n    ├── torvalds-linux.yml\\n    └── microsoft-vscode.yml\\n```\\n\\n**Benefits identified:**\\n- More intuitive file organization\\n- Eliminates folders.yml mapping complexity\\n- Natural mixing of own/starred repos\\n- Easy to browse in GitHub web interface\\n- Drag-and-drop = file moves\\n\\n## File Structure Details Designed\\n\\n**schema.yml example:**\\n```yaml\\nversion: \\\"1.0\\\"\\ncolumns:\\n  priority:\\n    type: \\\"integer\\\"\\n    min: 1\\n    max: 5\\n    default: 3\\n  technology_stack:\\n    type: \\\"array\\\"\\n    items: \\\"string\\\"\\n  last_reviewed:\\n    type: \\\"date\\\"\\n    format: \\\"YYYY-MM-DD\\\"\\n  notes:\\n    type: \\\"text\\\"\\n    multiline: true\\n  custom_url:\\n    type: \\\"url\\\"\\n    validation: \\\"^https?://\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**_folder.yml example:**\\n```yaml\\nname: \\\"Web Apps\\\"\\ndescription: \\\"Active web application projects\\\"\\ncolor: \\\"#3498db\\\"\\ncreated: \\\"2025-09-12\\\"\\n```\\n\\n**Individual repo file example:**\\n```yaml\\ntype: \\\"own\\\"\\nfolder_id: \\\"active.webapps\\\"\\nfields:\\n  priority: 5\\n  technology_stack: [\\\"python\\\", \\\"flask\\\", \\\"javascript\\\"]\\n  notes: \\\"Personal project for GitHub repo organization\\\"\\n  last_reviewed: \\\"2025-09-12\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Update Strategy Discussion\\n\\n**Assistant presented three options:**\\n1. Immediate save (every change commits)\\n2. Session-based save (save button or navigate away)\\n3. Auto-save with throttling (30 seconds of inactivity)\\n\\n**User chose:** Session-based save with auto-save backup to localStorage\\n\\n## Data Conflict Resolution Strategy\\n\\n**Assistant designed resolution approach:**\\n```python\\ndef resolve_field_conflicts(repo_data, schema):\\n    resolved = {}\\n    errors = []\\n    \\n    for field_name, value in repo_data.get('fields', {}).items():\\n        schema_field = find_schema_field_ignore_case(field_name, schema)\\n        \\n        if not schema_field:\\n            errors.append(f\\\"Unknown field '{field_name}' treated as text\\\")\\n            resolved[field_name.lower()] = str(value)\\n            continue\\n            \\n        try:\\n            resolved[schema_field['canonical_name']] = coerce_to_type(value, schema_field)\\n        except ValidationError as e:\\n            errors.append(f\\\"Field '{field_name}': {e.message}, using default\\\")\\n            resolved[schema_field['canonical_name']] = schema_field.get('default')\\n    \\n    return resolved, errors\\n```\\n\\n## Cleanup Strategy\\n\\n**Assistant proposed:** Keep manifest in folders.yml, flag orphaned files, user decides to delete/reassign, auto-cleanup after 30 days.\\n\\n**User feedback:**\\n- Move to \\\"archived\\\" right away (no delay)\\n- Make orphaned items feel natural with separate \\\"Archived\\\" view\\n- Use \\\"unlink/disconnect\\\" terminology, not \\\"delete\\\"\\n- When user \\\"unlinks\\\", make clear they're removing notes/custom fields about repo\\n\\n**User added:** For field deletion, warn user if non-empty values exist: \\\"This will permanently delete N nonempty values ([list examples]...) are you sure?\\\"\\n\\n## Final Clarifications Round\\n\\n**User's final decisions:**\\n- ✅ Physical folders approach\\n- **Auto-save strategy:** Every 30 seconds IF changes detected, PLUS immediate auto-save for structural changes (folder nesting, field names, etc.)\\n- **Validation on folder moves:** Yes, validate repo metadata compatibility\\n- **Bulk operations:** File under \\\"future updates\\\" section\\n\\n## Final Architecture Summary\\n\\n**Tech Stack:**\\n- Frontend: Flask + Bootstrap 5 + jQuery\\n- Backend: Flask (Python)\\n- Storage: YAML files in GitHub repo (NO database)\\n- Authentication: GitHub OAuth\\n- Deployment: fly.io\\n- Caching: Browser cache for GitHub API responses\\n\\n**Data Management:**\\n- Field names: Case-sensitive in schema, case-insensitive (lowercase) in repo files\\n- Empty fields: Omitted from YAML, shown as empty in UI\\n- Field types: string, integer, float, boolean, date, array, url, enum, text\\n- Conflict resolution: Auto-coerce types, fallback to defaults, log errors\\n\\n**Save Strategy:**\\n- Immediate: Structural changes\\n- 30-second auto-save: Field value changes\\n- Navigation save: On page navigation/close\\n- Local backup: localStorage for unsaved changes\\n\\n**Data Cleanup:**\\n- Orphaned files → \\\"Archived\\\" folder immediately\\n- \\\"Unlink/Disconnect\\\" terminology\\n- Field deletion warnings with examples\\n- Separate archived view\\n\\n**UI Features:**\\n- Single expandable table with nested folders\\n- Both drag-and-drop AND context menus\\n- Custom typed columns\\n- Built-in metadata (type, visibility, stars, forks, dates)\\n- Single repo detail view\\n\\n**Future Considerations (V2+):**\\n- Bulk operations\\n- Advanced filtering/search\\n- Export functionality\\n- Sharing organization schemes\\n- Complex field types\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis brainstorming session resulted in a comprehensive architecture that balances simplicity with powerful organization capabilities, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure for storage while providing a rich user interface for repo management.\"}",

The application provides a clean, tabular interface for organizing repos into nested folders with custom metadata, notes, and tracking fields.\\n\\n**Problem:** Developers accumulate dozens or hundreds of GitHub repositories (own projects, forks, and starred repos) over time, making it difficult to maintain organization, track project status, remember context, or find specific repositories when needed.\\n\\n**Solution:** A web-based organizer that fetches all your GitHub repositories and starred projects, allows you to organize them into a hierarchical folder structure, and lets you add custom metadata, notes, and tracking information. All organization data is stored in a dedicated GitHub repository for version control and portability.\\n\\n**Impact:** Improved developer productivity through better repository organization, enhanced project tracking, and reduced time spent searching for or remembering project context.\"}",
